## LNSimplePhotoBrowser
A demo project about photo browser slideshow for iOS that written in Swift.
This was a project, not a library.

. Check out branch swift3 for supporting swift 3.

## It's

A photo browser slideshow that displays all photos and videos on collectionview with horizontal scrolling. The user swipes left/right to view next/previous item as well as interact on it: double tap to zoom an image or pinch gesture to zoom in/out image, play video from local or web(including YouTube, any links with video type extension) and streaming video.

Clone the project and take a minute for walking through the code base to see how it works.
Perhaps some videos' url was expired. Utilizing your videos' url instead.

I have applied POP-OOP-Functional programming for this project. Maybe my code is not good enough as its concepts, pleae coach me if possible.
